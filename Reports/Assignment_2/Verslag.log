put `1' after `\a', since control sequence names are
made up of letters only. The macro here has not been
followed by the required stuff, so I'm ignoring it.

For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce

your `}' was spurious, just type `2' and it will go away.

argument that might be the root of the problem. But if
your `}' was spurious, just type `2' and it will go away.

I've run across a `}' that doesn't seem to match anything.
For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce
this error. If you simply proceed now, the `\par' that
I've just inserted will cause me to report a runaway
argument that might be the root of the problem. But if
your `}' was spurious, just type `2' and it will go away.
