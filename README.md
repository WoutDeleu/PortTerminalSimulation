# ContainerYardAssignment
This is a project for the course 'simulation techniques'.

The setting we consider involves a port terminal quay along with its container yard. Vessels are scheduled to arrive at the port on a weekly basis and must be assigned a berthing position at the quay for the duration of their stay. Each vessel arrives carrying a number of containers which must first be discharged by Quay Cranes. These discharged containers must then be stored at storage locations in the yard, where they are transferred to by special carrier vehicles. The suitability of storage locations depends on the content type of containers along with their final destination. After this intermediary storage phase, containers are either transshipped and loaded onto other vessels or they are transferred to other areas of the yard to be processed internally or depart via land-based transportation. Similarly, containers which arrive via land-based transportation must first be stored in the yard before they are loaded into and depart with a vessel. For the purposes of this problem we consider all Berth Allocation and Crane assignment -related decisions as known, denoted as BAP.
