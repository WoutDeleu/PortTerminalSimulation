### Port Terminal Simulation Project 🚢

Welcome to the Port Terminal Simulation project! This project was developed as part of the 'Simulation Techniques' course and simulates the operations of a port terminal quay and its container yard. A full simulation model can be found including a visualization. This makes it possible to get characteristics and stats of different possible scenarios, as well as detect possible problems with hypothetical cases.

🌐 **Project Overview**
The simulation involves the scheduling of vessels arriving at the port, berthing positions assignment, unloading of containers by Quay Cranes, storage in the yard, and subsequent transfers based on content type and final destination. The decisions related to Berth Allocation and Crane assignment are considered as known (BAP) for this problem.

💡 **How to Use**
To run the simulation, execute the `main.py` script. Adjust the simulation parameters and observe the results to gain insights into port terminal operations.
